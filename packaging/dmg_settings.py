"""dmgbuild settings for the SSH Tunnel Manager release DMG.

Produces a styled drag-to-Applications disk image *without* driving Finder /
AppleScript (so it's reliable on CI). Used by .github/workflows/release.yml:

    DMG_APP="path/to/SSHTunnelManager.app" \
        dmgbuild -s packaging/dmg_settings.py "SSH Tunnel Manager" SSHTunnelManager.dmg

# both locally and in CI (dmgbuild execs this file without defining __file__).
app = os.environ["DMG_APP"]
appname = os.path.basename(app)

# Compressed, read-only image.
format = "UDZO"

# Branded background (arrow app -> Applications, drop-zone outline). HiDPI TIFF.
